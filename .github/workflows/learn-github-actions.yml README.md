## Breakdown of the learn-github-actions workflow:

This workflow, named `learn-github-actions`, is designed to check the installed version of the "bats" testing framework. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**1. Workflow Configuration:**

- **name:** The workflow is named `learn-github-actions` to provide a clear description of its purpose.
- **run-name:** The dynamic name `{{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions` is set for the workflow run, where `{{ github.actor }}` is a context variable that gets replaced with the username of the person who triggered the workflow (e.g., JohnDoe is learning GitHub Actions).
- **on:** The workflow is triggered on the `push` event, meaning it runs whenever there's a push to any branch in the repository.

**2. Job Definition:**

- **jobs:** The workflow defines a single job named `check-bats-version`.
- **runs-on:** This job specifies that it should run on a runner machine with the `ubuntu-latest` operating system.

**3. Job Steps:**

- **Step 1:**
    - `uses: actions/checkout@v4` - This step uses the `actions/checkout@v4` action from the GitHub Actions marketplace. It checks out the code from the repository to the runner's workspace, making it available for subsequent steps.

- **Step 2:**
    - `uses: actions/setup-node@v4` - This step uses the `actions/setup-node@v4` action. It sets up a Node.js environment on the runner machine.
        - `with: node-version: '20'` - This option specifies that we want Node.js version 20 to be installed. You can adjust this version if needed.

- **Step 3:**
    - `run: npm install -g bats` - This step runs a command that uses the `npm` package manager to install the "bats" testing framework globally (`-g`) on the runner machine.

- **Step 4:**
    - `run: bats -v` - This step executes the `bats` command with the `-v` flag, which prints the installed version of the "bats" framework. The output of this command will be displayed in the workflow log. This step essentially checks if the installation was successful and shows the version.

**Overall, this workflow demonstrates how to set up a Node.js environment, install a tool using npm, and execute a command on a runner machine within a GitHub Actions workflow.**
